Vitam Project
=============

You will find here one of the sub projects of Vitam (Valuable Items Transfered to Archives for Memory / Valeurs Immaterielles Tranferees aux Archives pour Memoire).

The global license is GPL V3.

The Vitam project is hold by several french entities, among them the French National Archives, the French Diplomatic Archives and the French Defense Archives.

Those applications are by no mean a definitive product but a prototype to try and test different options in the preliminary steps of the Vitam Project.


This Project is about writing the VITAM schema, both in XML and JSON format.
